# note.nvim ðŸ““

A Neovim note taking plugin for daily notes, task tracking and easy deep linking across files or git commits.

## Motivation
The goal is to reduce the cost of interruptions and make it easy to recontextualize when you return to work in progress. Nested task items, deep links, time-based logging and being able to mark items as current makes it easy to take a fairly detailed snapshot of your 'working heap'.

## Setup
```lua
use 'gsuuon/note.nvim'
```

### Configuration
With lazy.nvim:
```lua
  {
    'gsuuon/note.nvim',
    opts = {
      -- Spaces are note roots. These directories should contain a `./notes` directory (will be made if not).
      -- Defaults to { '~' }.
      spaces = {
        '~',
        -- '~/projects/foo'
      },

      -- Set keymap = false to disable keymapping
      -- keymap = { 
      --   prefix = '<leader>n'
      -- }
    },
    cmd = 'Note',
    ft = 'note'
  }
```

### Tree-sitter
A [tree-sitter grammar](https://github.com/gsuuon/tree-sitter-note) can be installed with `:TSInstall note`. The grammar includes markdown style code-fenced injections of other languages and makes it possible to use treesitter based navigation like [tshjkl](https://github.com/gsuuon/tshjkl.nvim) with note items.

#### Highlights
The treesitter highlight groups are linked in [ftplugin/note.lua](ftplugin/note.lua) and the group queries are in [queries/note/highlights.scm](queries/note/highlights.scm). You can customize these by overriding the groups with your own links or highlights.

## Usage
Open the daily note with `:Note`. This can be scoped to a workspace root with the `spaces` config option:
```lua
require('note').setup({
  spaces = { '~', '~/myproject' }
})
```
You can create a custom template for daily notes at `[note_root]/.note/daily_template`. note comes with [treesitter based highlighting](#tree-sitter) but falls back to a syntax file if the grammar is not installed.

[Keymaps](#keymaps) are added for note.nvim commands with a default prefix of `<leader>n`.

### Items
Items can be properties or tasks. The first character is a marker that indicates the type and status of the item, some examples:
```
- pending task
  * info property
. finished task
  [ label property
  . sub task
```

Items are indent scoped - a newline and 2 spaces start a child item scope. They can contain any text content. Anything below an item which doesn't start a new scope becomes part of the text content of that item.
````
- a pending task
```js
const scratchFn = () => {}
```
- other task
````

#### Tasks
`>` â€” current  
`-` â€” pending  
`.` â€” done  
`=` â€” paused  
`,` â€” cancelled  

#### Properties
`*` â€” info  
`[` â€” label  

#### Sections
`#` â€” section -- Not indented - the number of #'s mean depth like markdown.  

### Modifiers
Some special symbols will also highlight to help with readability:

`->` â€” flow -- indicates one thing flowing to another  
`<-` â€” select -- indicates selecting one of a list  
`(?)` â€” question -- draw attention to something confusing  
`(!)` â€” warn -- draw attention to something important  

### Links
Links to items are created by simply writing text like `[(<file>)<marker>|<body>]`. Follow a link by putting the cursor over it and calling `:NoteGoLink`. This will search for a target item first by looking downwards from the link and then upwards. The file part can point to a specific commit.

- `<body>` behaves like a case-insensitive `string.match` against items.
- `(<file>)` if present links to that file relative to the current file - the path is joined with the current file's directory. If the file part starts with `/` then the path is resolved relative to the note root.
- `(<file>@<commit>)` links to the file at a specific commit. The git root must be the same as the note workspace root.  
- `<marker>` is a specific marker (e.g. `-`, `*`) or one of these special characters:

`s` â€” section -- matches any number of #'s  
`p` â€” property -- matches any property marker  
`t` â€” task -- matches any task marker  

For example:

`[t|clean]` links to a task containing 'clean'  
`[(chores)s|daily]` links to a file in the same directory as the current file named 'chores' and finds the first section with 'daily'  
`[(/budget)t|groceries]` links to the 'budget' file in the note root and finds the first 'groceries' task  

## Examples
![note](https://github.com/gsuuon/note.nvim/assets/6422188/813e74e7-d9dc-4b5f-b433-4ef294491797)

`Take out the trash` is labeled as a `[ chore`.
```
- Take out the trash
  [ chore
```

`Pick up toys` is the current (`>`) task and is part of `Cleanup house`.
```
- Cleanup house
  - Wash dishes
  > Pick up toys
```

`[t|monday]` links to the `- Monday` task and `[(../health)s|goal]` links to the the 'health' file up one directory at a section matching `goal`.
```
[t|monday]
# Gym
- Monday
  - Squats
[(../health)s|goal]
```
